*The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.*
