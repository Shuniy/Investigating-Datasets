# Investigate Titanic Database

## Introduction

*The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.*

*On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.* 
*Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.*

*While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.*

***"One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class."***

## Conclusions

- Based on the raw numbers it would appear as though passengers in Class 3 had a similar survival rate as those from Class 1 with 119 and 136 passengers surviving respectively. However, looking at the percentages of the overall passengers per class and the total numbers across each class, it can be assumed that a passenger from Class 1 is about 2.5x times more likely to survive than a passenger in Class 3.

- From the analysis, it appears to indicate that class and sex, being a female with upper social-economic standing (first class), would give one the best chance of survival when the tragedy occurred on the Titanic. Age did not seem to be a major factor. While being a man in third class, gave one the lowest chance of survival. Women and children, across all classes, tend to have a higher survival rate than men in genernal but by no means did being a child or woman guarentee survival. Although, overall, children accompanied by parents (or nannies) had the best survival rate at over 50%.
